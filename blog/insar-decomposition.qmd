## Introduction

The 2D+1D decomposition technique is a powerful tool for analyzing landslides. It provides:
- Resolution of horizontal and vertical components.
- Enhanced accuracy in complex terrains like high-mountain regions.

## Key Applications
- Monitoring slow-moving landslides.
- Studying deformation in permafrost areas.
- Investigating seismic cycles and fault interactions.
